# The Chaquopy Gradle plugin will be built against this version of the gradleApi()
# dependency (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/1835), so this should be no higher
# than the Gradle version that corresponds to MIN_AGP_VERSION.
#
# However, increasing this to 7.0.2 resulted in a plugin which was incompatible with
# Gradle 6 (https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin/issues/193 and
# https://discuss.gradle.org/t/my-plugin-cant-be-applied-when-plugin-is-built-with-gradle-7-1-1/40464).
# So don't change it until Gradle 6 is below our minimum requirement -- in fact, so far
# below that it isn't even being tested by AndroidPlugin.test_old.
#
# Once this is upgraded to 6.9 or later, Common.findExecutable can be removed.
